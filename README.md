The header has the information of what this webpage is and to make it look attractive I added some social media icons which on by clicking leading to my that social media handel.
The footer has the information about how designed and developed this webpage.
The body of the webpage has a search box on the top right corner by which we can search the cities and can access the weather condition .And it has a grid box in the centre which have the information of that particular day weather i.e. itâ€™s temperature humidity ,condition , wind speed, date and time. 
After the grid box there is a divider and below the divider the information of the next seven days weather forecast is there.
